To run it, you need an iterative Matlab session and also to have access to the 
processed data. You can also run the executable (WIP)

# Step 1

After opening Matlab, add to your current session the path to the code. For example, if the code lives in `C:\Users\oscar\OneDrive\matlab_code`, 
you need to type in Matlab:

```matlab
addpath(genpath('C:\Users\oscar\OneDrive\matlab_code'))
```

Alternatively, run the executable (WIP).

# Step 2

Next, open the GUI_environments by simply typing in your Matlab terminal “GUI_environments”:

```matlab
>> GUI_environments
```
